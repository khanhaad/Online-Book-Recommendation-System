              A book recommendation system is a type of recommendation system where we have to recommend similar books to the reader based on his interest.
              It works on the principle of popularity or anything which is in trend. 
              It can help introduce users to books excluding their interest, introducing them to new genres, authors, and styles they may not have considered before.
              It filters information by using the interactions and data collected by the system from other users.
              It’s based on the idea that people who agreed in their evaluation of certain books are likely to agree again in the future.

              Nowadays, everyone relies on reviews from others for a variety of decisions, including choosing a movie to watch, purchasing goods, and reading a book.
              A recommendation system had to be created because everything is based on reviews. A type of filtering system called a "recommender system" predicts how a user will rate an item. 
              Using a ranked list of predicted ratings of items, recommender systems sort through a large database of information to suggest items to users.
              As indicated by the examination done and data gathered, we chose to foster a framework for prescribing books to the clients on their own advantage considering the past clients records of the books survey 
              and evaluations and the channels applied by the client on the book proposal as per their necessities.
